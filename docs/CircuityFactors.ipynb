To do so, we first segment the city in homogeneous areas of one square kilometer each . We call each of this areas a 'pixel'. Then, within each pixel, we simulated a large number of trips using the Google Maps to obtain the real travel distance. Then, with the coordinates of the origin and destination of each individual trip, the euclidean distance can be obtained. Finally, the ratio between the real distance and the euclidean distance gives us the circuity factor of a trip. We report these results at the pixel level. In total, nearly 600,000 trips were analyzed for both cities."

Analyzing the predictors in a bit more depth, we see that road connectivity (i.e. the number of intersections in one pixel) is the most relevant predictor in both case studies. We also see that predictors related to highway distance and capacity and road distance and capacity are important predictors (note that the difference between distance and capacity is that capacity accounts for the number of lanes per road). Intuitively, we would expect that an increased presence of highways increases the circuity factor, while increase the road distance decreases the circuity factor. \n",

A potential explanation for this could be that in the Bay Area, the areas with highways tend to be the less populated areas, while in Sao Paulo the highways cross the highly dense urban areas.
